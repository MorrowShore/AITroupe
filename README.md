# AITroupe Discord Bot
Bot that has AI talk to each other in personas. [Inspired by DougDoug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPh-wiS8sjI).

The AI personas respond with context to one another, and to humans!<br>

When you mention the names of the personas, or reply to one of their messages, they answer back as well.<br>
